# Restaurant Ingredient Inventory System (RIIS)

## Introduction
The **Restaurant Ingredient Inventory System (RIIS)** is a web-based platform designed to help restaurants and small businesses automate and streamline their inventory management processes.  
Traditionally, many businesses still rely on physical records or spreadsheets to track ingredients, which often leads to data duplication, loss, human error, and inefficient stock handling. RIIS addresses these challenges by providing a secure, reliable, and user-friendly system that manages ingredients, suppliers, categories, and purchase records in real time.  

By integrating automation and digital tracking, RIIS reduces paperwork, minimizes stock miscounts, provides timely low-stock alerts, and ensures centralized data access â€” all while saving valuable time during daily operations.
